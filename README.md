Python module that deals with the quarkonium transport inside the quark-gluon plasma. The dissociation rate is calculated in pNRQCD for the Upsilon(1S) state in the file rate.py and generate three hdf5 tables for later sampling. The Quarkonium_decay.py is a module. Inside it, the class QQbar_decay can give the gluo-dissociation rate at a given temperature and center-of-mass momentum, sample the initial incoming gluon in the hydro cell frame and sample the final QQbar relative momentum in the rest frame of quarkonium.

Quarkonium_recombine.py is the module for recombination. It can return the recombination cross section given the momenta and positions of the QQbar and the local temperature. It can determine whether recombination occurs and sample the final outgoing gluon momentum in the c.o.m. frame of the QQbar. The quarkonium should move in the opposite direction. All these are for gluo-formation.

Quarkonium_evolution.py is the module for evolution. So far it has the static meidum mode with the decay process implemented. The initial condistions are sampled from uniform distributions in a box. The heavy quarks, anti-quarks and quarkonium (Upsilon(1S)) is free streaming first and then, the decay process is considered. It will update the position and momentum lists for all three particels.
