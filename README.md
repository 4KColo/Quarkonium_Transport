Python module that deals with the quarkonium transport inside the quark-gluon plasma. The dissociation rate is calculated in pNRQCD for the Upsilon(1S) state in the file rate.py and generate three hdf5 tables for later sampling. The Quarkonium_decay.py is a module. Inside it, the class QQbar_decay can give the gluo-dissociation rate at a given temperature and center-of-mass momentum, sample the initial incoming gluon in the hydro cell frame and sample the final QQbar relative momentum in the rest frame of quarkonium.
